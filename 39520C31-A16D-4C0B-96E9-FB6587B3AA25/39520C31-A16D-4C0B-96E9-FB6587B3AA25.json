My strategy:\n\n0. Make sense of the data to some extent.\n1. Download all of the downloadable files using some wget scraper.\n2. Verify whether or not the downloaded dataset corresponds to beta.fec.gov.\n\n# Understanding the data\n\nOk, so it's somewhat convoluted. For example in the individual schema, rather than specifying recipient explicitly, an ID is specified instead. To make sense of the data you'd need to join individual contributions (https://goo.gl/lS9HPY) with the master committee data (https://goo.gl/eKdcv4). \n\n# Downloading the data\n\nTurns out all of the raw data is available via FTP: ftp://ftp.fec.gov/FEC/",
